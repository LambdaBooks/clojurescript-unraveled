## Tooling & Compiler

This chapter will cover a little introduction to existing tooling for making things easy when developing using ClojureScript. It will cover:

* Using the REPL
* Leiningen and cljsbuild
* Google Closure Library
* Modules
* Unit testing
* Library development
* Browser based development
* Server based development

Unlike the previous chapter, this chapter intends to tell different stories each independent of the other.

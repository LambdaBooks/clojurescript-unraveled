## First steps with Lisp syntax

Invented by John McCarthy in 1958, Lisp is one of the oldest programming languages that is still around. It has evolved into many derivatives called dialects, ClojureScript being one of them. It is a programming language written in its own data structures — originally lists enclosed in parentheses — but Clojure(Script) has evolved the Lisp syntax with more data structures, making it more pleasant to write and read.

A list with a function in the first position is used for calling a function in ClojureScript. In the example below, we apply the addition function to three arguments. Note that unlike in other languages, `+` is not an operator but a function. Lisp has no operators; it only has functions. 

[source, clojure]
----
(+ 1 2 3)
;; => 6
----

In the example above, we're applying the addition function `+` to the arguments `1`, `2` and `3`. ClojureScript allows any unusual characters like `?` or `-` in symbol names, which makes it easier to read:

[source, clojure]
----
(zero? 0)
;; => true
----

To distinguish function calls from lists of data items, we can quote lists to keep them from being evaluated.  The uoted lists will be treated as data instead of as a function call:

[source, clojure]
----
'(+ 1 2 3)
;; => (+ 1 2 3)
----

ClojureScript uses more than lists for its syntax. The full details will be covered later, but here is an example of the usage of a vector (enclosed in brackets) for defining local bindings:

[source, clojure]
----
(let [x 1
      y 2
      z 3]
  (+ x y z))
;; => 6
----

This is practically all the syntax we need to know for using not only ClojureScript, but any Lisp. Being written in its own data structures (often referred to as _homoiconicity_) is a great property since the syntax is uniform and simple; also, code generation via xref:macros-section[macros] is easier than in any other language, giving us plenty of power to extend the language to suit our needs.
